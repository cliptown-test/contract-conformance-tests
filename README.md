# cliptown-test/contract-conformance-tests

Deterministic state-model, idempotency, serialization, and protocol contract conformance tests.

This repository is the `contract` deep-test suite for `cliptown`. It is intentionally dependency-light and deterministic so failures can be reproduced locally without production credentials or customer data.

## Run

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/verify_repository.py
```

The initial model is executable rather than a placeholder. Product adapters should be added through focused pull requests while preserving the reference-model tests as an oracle.
